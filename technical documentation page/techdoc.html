                <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
                    It is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, data science, and scripting.
                </p>
                <p>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
                    relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some programming experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If not, please find a link to a beginners guide in the <a href="#reference">Reference</a> section.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <article>
                <p>To get started, open your IDE (Intergrated Development Environment). Our first code is the standard "Hello World" text.</p>
                <code>
                    print("Hello World!")
                </code>
                <p>Run the code and see the output in your terminal.</p>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>Variables are names given to certain locations in memory i.e. storing data/variables using names or labels.
                    Unlike other languages like Javascript, Python has no command for declaring varibales.
                </p>
                <code>
                    greeting = "Hello World!"
                    print(greeting)
                </code>
                <p>There are rules to follow when creating variables in Python.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A variable name can't start with a number.</li>
                    <li>A variable name can only contain letters, numbers and underscores e.g. 
                        <code>
                            greet = "Hello"
                            greet2 = "Hi"
                            _greet = "Â¡Hola!"
                        </code></li>
                    <li>A variable name can't be a keyword.</li>
                    <li>A variable name can't contain spaces e.g. <code>greet 2 = "Hi"</code> This variable name will result in an error.</li>
                    <li>A variable name can not start with a number. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Python also doesn't require declaring the data type of the value.</p>
                <code>
                    a = "Hi!" # a is a string.
                    b = 43    # b is an integer.
                    c = 43.0  # c is a float
                </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <article>
                <p>Scope is the part of the program where a variable can be accessed. Not all variables created can be accessed from anywhere 
                    in a program. There are four major types of scope:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local scope:</strong> When a variable is declared, it is accessible from then until the end of the program. It is available 
                    for as long as the program is running. This is true especially when it is created in a function. It will be accessible only within the function.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enclosing scope:</strong> This scope applies to nested functions. When a variable is declared in the first(outer) function, it can be 
                    accessed by the second(inner) function but a variable declared in the second function can't be accessed by the first function.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global scope:</strong> When a function is declared outside a function, it can be accessed by any function for instance if a variable is declared
                    before the first nested function, it can be accessed by both the first and second function.</li>
                    <li><strong>Built-in scope:</strong> This applies to reserved keywords. Keywords are words reserved by Python for specific purposes and can't be used for anything else.</li>
                </ul>
